OpenCode plugins for the [Nexus](https://nexus.gatewarden.eu) platform.

These plugins extend OpenCode with deep Nexus integration. Each plugin targets a
specific problem in the agent lifecycle: session continuity across compaction
events, cost visibility via session timeline recording, and context budget
management through pre-injection compression of Nexus MCP outputs.

Plugins are standalone `.ts` files — no build step, no monorepo toolchain. Each
plugin is independently installable via the OpenCode auto-discovery mechanism
(`.opencode/plugins/`).

## Compaction Plus

**`v1.8.1` · [`100-compaction-plus`](./100-compaction-plus)**

OpenCode compacts long conversations to manage context budget. During
compaction, the LLM generates a continuation summary from the conversation
history — but Nexus state (active session, open tasks, recent ADRs, project
directives) is not part of that history in a structured way, so it risks being
lost or summarized away.

This plugin solves that by hooking directly into the compaction lifecycle:

- **`experimental.session.compacting`** -- Before the LLM generates the
  continuation summary, the plugin injects structured Nexus context: active
  session ID, open tasks, recent ADRs, enabled directives, and key file paths.
  The compacted summary retains awareness of ongoing Nexus work.

- **`session.compacted`** -- After compaction completes, the plugin appends a
  `compaction` entry to the active Nexus session via MCP. This creates an
  auditable trail of compaction events in the session timeline.

**Required:** Nexus MCP server (`NEXUS_API_URL`, `NEXUS_PRIVATE_TOKEN`)

## Cost Control

**`v1.0.1` · [`200-cost-control`](./200-cost-control)**

Makes token usage and cost visible in the Nexus session timeline by connecting
[Helicone](https://helicone.ai) -- an LLM observability proxy -- to the Nexus
session recording pipeline.

- **Session grouping** -- injects the active Nexus session ID as a
  `Helicone-Session-Id` property so every LLM call in a session is grouped and
  queryable in the Helicone dashboard.

- **`session.idle` recording** -- when the agent finishes a work burst, queries
  Helicone for cumulative token and cost data and appends a structured summary
  to the Nexus session timeline. Recording is debounced (5-minute minimum
  interval) to avoid timeline noise.

- **`nexus_cost_summary` tool** -- exposes an agent-callable tool for on-demand
  live cost snapshots at any point in a session.

**Required:** `HELICONE_API_KEY`, Nexus MCP server  
**Roadmap:** `v2.0.0` will read cost data from OpenCode native message data,
removing the Helicone dependency.

## Headroom Intercept

**`v0.5.14` · [`300-headroom-intercept`](./300-headroom-intercept)**

Nexus MCP tools can return large payloads -- `kb_memory` at `depth: deep`,
`dispatch_inbox` with many entries, `kb_search` result sets -- that consume
significant context budget before the agent can decide whether to compress
them. The Headroom MCP tools (`headroom_compress`, `headroom_retrieve`)
operate post-hoc: by the time the agent calls them, the original output is
already in the context window.

This plugin moves compression to the runtime layer via the `tool.execute.after`
hook, intercepting Nexus MCP outputs before they enter the agent context:

```
MCP tool executes -> result returned -> tool.execute.after fires
  -> plugin evaluates policy -> if threshold exceeded: store original,
    replace output with compact summary -> compact result enters context
```

Compression is policy-based and per-tool: each Nexus MCP tool has an explicit
action (`compress`, `passthrough`, `skip`) with a configurable token threshold
and compression profile. Originals are retrievable via the plugin's own
`nexus_headroom_intercept_retrieve` tool (in-memory + disk cache, 24h TTL).

**Default mode:** `observe` (metrics only, no mutation -- safe for all environments)  
**Transform mode:** requires `HEADROOM_MODE=transform`

## Session Guard

**`v1.1.2` · [`adapters/opencode/session-guard`](./adapters/opencode/session-guard) (OpenCode) · [`adapters/claude-code/session-guard`](./adapters/claude-code/session-guard) (Claude Code)**

> This plugin has been migrated to the ADR-C05 `core/` + `adapters/` structure
> as the Track B2 pilot. Shared trigger-detection logic lives in
> `core/session-guard/logic.ts`; the OpenCode and Claude Code adapters each
> wire it to their respective runtime hooks.

Agents frequently skip `nexus_session_append` calls after completing work
packages, leaving gaps in the session audit trail. This plugin detects
code-changing tool completions and reminds the agent to append a session entry
before proceeding.

- **`tool.execute.after`** -- detects trigger tools (`Edit`, `Write`,
  `MultiEdit`, mutating `Bash`, `nexus_task_create`, `nexus_adr_create`,
  `nexus_adr_decide`) and injects a `<system-reminder>` into tool output when
  `nexus_session_append` hasn't been called since the last user instruction.

- **`event (message.created)`** -- tracks user turn index to determine work
  unit boundaries. The reminder fires once per user turn until an append is
  recorded.

- **Bash heuristic** -- read-only commands (`cat`, `grep`, `git status`,
  `ls`, `npm ls`, etc.) are excluded from triggers to avoid false positives.

**Required:** Nexus MCP server (session must be active)  
**Ref:** ADR-0066

## Routing Guard

**`v1.0.0` · [`500-routing-guard`](./500-routing-guard)**

Nexus writes agent-to-provider/model routing into a project's
`opencode.json`, but that routing can silently diverge from what the running
OpenCode instance can actually serve (merged global + project provider
catalog). This plugin detects the divergence directly from the running
server, at model granularity rather than provider granularity, since a
provider can be entirely valid while a single model id is wrong.

- **`experimental.chat.system.transform`** -- reliably informs the agent of
  any divergence and instructs it to relay the warning to the operator.

- **`tool.execute.after`** -- injects a deterministic, one-shot banner into
  the first tool call's output of the session when a divergence is detected.
  Silent when the config is clean; never repeats within a session.

- **Warning codes:** `unknown_provider` (provider absent from the instance
  catalog), `unknown_model` (provider present, model id not in its catalog).

**Required:** none (no Nexus MCP session needed)  
**Ref:** ADR-0001

## Attribution Headers

**`v1.0.0` · [`600-attribution-headers`](./600-attribution-headers)**

The Nexus gateway records usage events for cost and routing analytics, but
without session/actor attribution headers on the outgoing request, it has
no way to tell which OpenCode session or agent a given request belongs to.
This plugin closes that gap.

- **`chat.headers`** -- when the request is routed through the `nexus`
  provider, sets `x-nexus-session-id` always, plus either
  `x-nexus-primary-slot` (for `nexus-plan`/`nexus-act`/`nexus-review`) or
  `x-nexus-actor-slug` (for every other agent name, including OpenCode's
  own internal calls). Attribution-only; never used for routing or auth.

- **Provider-scoped** -- guards on the runtime shape of `input.provider`,
  which does not match the hook's documented TypeScript type (see the
  plugin README for the discrepancy). Never touches non-`nexus` providers.

**Required:** none (no Nexus MCP session needed)  
**Ref:** dispatch `5999b7d6` (NEXUS-APP)

## Installation

Each plugin is a single `.ts` file. Drop it into `.opencode/plugins/` and
OpenCode auto-discovers it on the next start.

```bash
# Example: install Compaction Plus
cp 100-compaction-plus/nexus-compaction-plus.ts /path/to/project/.opencode/plugins/
```

Declare the SDK dependency in `.opencode/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@opencode-ai/plugin": "^1.14.0"
  }
}
```

Set the shared environment variables:

```bash
export NEXUS_API_URL="https://nexus.gatewarden.eu"
export NEXUS_PRIVATE_TOKEN="nxs_pat_..."
```

See each plugin's README for plugin-specific configuration.

When using `nexus init` or `nexus pull`, recommended plugins are downloaded
automatically based on your project configuration.

Session Guard is the ADR-C05 Track B2 pilot plugin: it has been migrated out
of `400-session-guard/` into `core/` + `adapters/opencode/` +
`adapters/claude-code/`. The remaining plugins will follow the same pattern
as Track B2 proceeds (`300-headroom-intercept` next, then
`100-compaction-plus`, `500-routing-guard`, `200-cost-control`;
`600-attribution-headers` is explicitly not ported to Claude Code per
ADR-C08).
